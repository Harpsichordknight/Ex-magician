# Tech-God

Yes, I know you will find this hard to believe, but I actually am a tech-god. I set up this page all by myself, and even linked it to my domain. Look at that web address! All through the power of searching stuff online like an idiot, and extensive trial and error (mostly error). Next stop, curing cancer.

# Theme

Did you notice I'm using a theme? And it doesn't look utterly terrible. The learning curve to set-up a slightly nicer one seems a bit vertical though. 

I am writing in markdown apparently. *Look italics*. **Look, bold.**  

Learning how to type the hash symbol on this keyboard might make life easier for some of this.

Seems adding uploading my own image would be massively more 麻烦 though。

Next stop, trying to have more than one page on this site.
